## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- OpenRouter API selected as sole AI provider for multi-model access (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4 Turbo, Perplexity)

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 3 (Content Generation Core):**
- Turkish prompt engineering needs iterative testing with multiple models for quality consistency
- HTML encoding for Turkish characters (i, s, g, u, o, c with diacritics) requires dedicated Markdown-to-HTML conversion with UTF-8 validation

**Phase 5 (Internal Linking System):**
- Contextual anchor text algorithm is custom implementation requiring validation with 20+ posts

**Phase 7 (Error Handling):**
- OpenRouter rate limits and quotas need verification (training data from Jan 2025 may be outdated)
